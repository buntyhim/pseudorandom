# pseudorandom numbers on an FPGA

Hardware programming with Verilog on FPGAs. LFSRs for pseudorandom output generation.

![FPGA Prototyping](https://github.com/madhav-datt/hardware-programming/blob/master/Resources/fpga.jpg)

When the outputs of the flip-flops are loaded with a seed value and when the LFSR is clocked, it will generate a pseudorandom pattern of 1s and 0s.
